To check the Redis server data in Windows, after installing Redis and setting the environment variable, you can follow these steps to interact with Redis:

### 1. **Ensure Redis is Running**
First, confirm that the Redis server is running on your Windows machine.

1. Open a command prompt (`cmd`) or PowerShell.
2. Type the following command to start the Redis server:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```
   This will start the Redis server. You should see logs that indicate the server is running.

If you haven't yet started Redis, this is a necessary step before interacting with it.

### 2. **Check Redis Server Status**
Once the Redis server is running, open another command prompt or PowerShell window, and use the following command to check Redis server status:

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

If the server is running, you should see a response like:

```
PONG
```

### 3. **View Redis Data**
To check the data stored in your Redis server, you can use the `redis-cli` (Redis command-line interface). Here are a few commands that can help you inspect data:

- **View all keys:**
  To list all the keys stored in Redis, you can use:
  ```bash
  redis-cli keys "*"
  ```
  This command will display all the keys currently stored in the Redis database.

- **Check data for a specific key:**
  To retrieve the value of a specific key, use the `get` command if the value is a string:
  ```bash
  redis-cli get <key_name>
  ```
  Replace `<key_name>` with the actual key you want to inspect.

- **View more detailed information:**
  For more complex types (like lists, sets, hashes), you can use other commands like:

  - For **list** type data:
    ```bash
    redis-cli lrange <list_key> 0 -1
    ```

  - For **set** type data:
    ```bash
    redis-cli smembers <set_key>
    ```

  - For **hash** type data:
    ```bash
    redis-cli hgetall <hash_key>
    ```

### 4. **Check Redis Configuration**
If you want to view the configuration settings for Redis, you can run:
```bash
redis-cli config get *
```
This will output the configuration parameters of your Redis instance.

### Troubleshooting
If you get an error when trying to execute `redis-cli` commands, make sure:
- Redis is running.
- You’ve correctly added Redis to your system’s PATH environment variable.
