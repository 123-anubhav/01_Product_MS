Explanation
Each property corresponds to a YAML setting, ensuring the circuit breaker works as intended:

register-health-indicator: Enables health indicators for this circuit breaker.
sliding-window-size: Determines how many calls to keep in the rolling window for calculating failure rates.
minimum-number-of-calls: Specifies the minimum number of calls before the circuit breaker evaluates the failure rate.
failure-rate-threshold: The percentage of failures required to open the circuit breaker.
wait-duration-in-open-state: Time the circuit breaker remains open before transitioning to half-open.
permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: Number of test calls allowed in the half-open state.


Observe how the circuit breaker transitions between states:
CLOSED: Normal state, all requests go through.
OPEN: Requests fail due to the threshold.
HALF-OPEN: Limited requests are allowed to test recovery.
